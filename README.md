# PLAYFUL PARTICLE SPAWNER
## CONTROLS:

1 to toggle looped or timed.
- Looped technically isn't a real loop, it'll fade after about 99999 ticks, but realistically its set that way due to how some of the particles are setup.
- Timed decays after a set time, dependent on the particle decaying particles may look slightly weird
- Rain is only on loop, it does not work on timed
- Lightning is only on timed, it does not work on loop.
- They technically will on either or, but it'll just generate particles until it either A) crashes, or lags out.

- W/S or Up/Down arrow to change which particle to spawn. Multiple particles can exist in the same space at once. 
- The window will be super laggy depending on what you do for this though. 

a Gif of all particles running at once has been provided. 

- LShift/RShift will clear the screen of any remaining particles
